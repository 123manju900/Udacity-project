## OverView
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run



## Summary ##
The dataset, I have worked on is Bank Marketing dataset. I have used Hyperdrive and automl for prediction of whether a customer has deposited or not. Here "Y" is my target variable.
With __Accuracy__ as primary metric, I have trained my dataset on _HyperDrive_ for tuning hyperparameters of Logistic Regression and got a accuracy score of **0.9042** and __automl__ with best algorithm it suggested as _MaxAbsScaler LightGBM_ and with a accuracy of **0.9161**.
